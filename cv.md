## **About myself**

My career started during my employment at the university as an assistant professor in the Refrigeration Systems department. I developed a multipage website for our department, showcasing our work and research.

As my passion for information and communication technologies (ICT) grew, I pursued further knowledge in this field. I obtained a Microsoft Certified Educator Certificate and actively participated in organizing the Microsoft IT Academy for students, helping them expand their ICT skills.

Currently, I am focused on enhancing my expertise in web development, leveraging modern tools and technologies. My ultimate goal is to acquire in-depth knowledge of modern web development techniques and utilize my skills to create highly functional applications.
